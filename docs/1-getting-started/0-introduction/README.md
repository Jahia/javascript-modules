Welcome to the JavaScript Modules documentation!

Currently in Beta, this technology is actively developed and the first stable version (v1) is scheduled for release in Autumn 2025. We actively support this new technology, and we consider it ready for production: you can build a production-ready Jahia website with JavaScript and React.

It is considered Beta as Jahia UI extensions and OSGi interactions can only be written in Java for now, these features are not yet available to JavaScript modules.

Here is what you would get within minutes. The code is written in React/JSX and made interactive on the client; Jahia is the first Java CMS to support [partial hydration/island architecture](https://www.jahia.com/blog/leveraging-the-island-architecture-in-jahia-cms) on the market.

This documentation is meant for self-learning, but we also offer workshops and training sessions with our team. If you are interested in that, please [contact us.](https://www.jahia.com/contact)
