# Building a Feedback Form

The goal of this self-contained guide is to create a feedback form that uses client-side JavaScript to send data to a server. This first half will be about building the form, the second half about collecting the data on the server with jCustomer.

We will build something very similar to the widget that can be found on many documentation websites:

![Sample Feedback Forms](./samples.png)

This guide assumes you have followed the [Getting Started](../1-getting-started/1-dev-environment/) guide and have a working Jahia instance with a JavaScript Module running on it. If you haven't done so, please follow the instructions in that guide before continuing.

## Client-Side JavaScript

The JavaScript Modules Library features a component we haven't used yet: `RenderInBrowser`. Contrary to the getting started, where all views were rendered on the server, this component allows you to render a component in the browser, and the browser only.

This render mode is useful for components that only make sense in the browser, because they need to be interactive, and are not usable without client-side JavaScript.

Let's start by creating a very basic node type and view for our feedback form:

- Create `src/components/FeedbackWidget/definition.cnd` with the following content (use the right namespace for your module):

  ```cnd
  [hydrogen:feedbackWidget] > jnt:content, hydrogenmix:component
  - question (string) = 'Was this helpful?'
  ```

  We'll keep this definition simple in this guide, but feel free to make the widget as configurable as desired.

- Create `src/components/FeedbackWidget/default.server.tsx` with the following content:

  ```tsx
  import { jahiaComponent } from "@jahia/javascript-modules-library";

  interface Props {
    question: string;
  }

  jahiaComponent(
    {
      nodeType: "hydrogen:feedbackWidget",
      componentType: "view",
    },
    ({ question }: Props) => <div>{question}</div>,
  );
  ```

Start or restart `yarn dev` to push the component to your local Jahia instance. Add your component to a page and check that it renders correctly. You should see "Was this helpful?" in the browser.

You can try replacing the `div` with `<button onClick={() => alert("Hello World!")}>Click me</button>` to see that the component, when rendered on the server, does not become interactive. **This is intended: the default rendering mode (Server-Side Rendering, SSR) ships no JavaScript to the browser.**

Let's create an interactive component: create a file named `src/components/FeedbackWidget/Widget.client.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx
export default function Widget() {
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        alert("Hello World!");
      }}
    >
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

You might have noticed that the file uses the `.client.tsx` extension: it will be transpiled during the client build step, whereas the `.server.tsx` files are transpiled during the server build step. These extensions can be changed in the `vite.config.js` file, but we recommend keeping the default ones for consistency with the rest of the community.

Update the `src/components/feedbackWidget/default.server.tsx` file to use the new component:

```tsx
import { jahiaComponent, RenderInBrowser } from "@jahia/javascript-modules-library";
import Widget from "./Widget.client.jsx";

interface Props {
  question: string;
}

jahiaComponent(
  {
    nodeType: "hydrogen:feedbackWidget",
    componentType: "view",
  },
  ({ question }: Props) => <Island clientOnly component={Widget} props={{ question }} />,
);
```

You'll need to restart `yarn dev` for Vite to collect your new client files, but once pushed, should see the exact same button as before, but now it will alert "Hello World!" when clicked.

The `Island` component is a wrapper that will ensure the code of `Widget` gets forwarded to the browser, enabling what is called Island Architecture: this component will be rendered client-side, but the rest of the page will remain server-rendered. This is a great way to improve performance, as it allows to only ship the JavaScript that is needed for the interactive parts of your page.

The `props` prop of `Island` allows you to pass props to the component that will be rendered in the browser. Because they will be sent to the browser, they should be serializable.

If you nest children to `Island` in `clientOnly` mode, they will be displayed until `Widget` is loaded. This is where you can put a loading message for instance: `<Island clientOnly component={Widget}>The widget is loading...</Island>`.

You now have all the tools needed to build any client-side component, but keep on reading to learn how to send data to jCustomer.

We'll build the simplest feedback form possible: two buttons, one for "yes" and one for "no". Styling is left as an exercise for the reader, we'll keep the default browser styles in this guide.

Update `Widget.client.tsx` to the following content:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Widget({ question }: { question: string }) {
  const [sent, setSent] = useState(false);

  const handler = (happy: boolean) => () => {
    // TODO: send `happy` somewhere
    setSent(true);
  };

  // Once clicked, thank the user for their feedback
  if (sent) return <aside>Thank you for your feedback!</aside>;

  return (
    <aside>
      {question}
      <button type="button" onClick={handler(true)}>
        Yes
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={handler(false)}>
        No
      </button>
    </aside>
  );
}
```

What matters now is what we place in `handler`. For now we only set a state variable to thank the user for their feedback, but that is not enough: we need to send the data to the server.

If you are using Google Tag Manager, you can use the `window.dataLayer` object to send data to GTM:

```tsx
// Replace TODO in the handler with this to push to GTM:
dataLayer.push({
  event: "feedback",
  happy,
});
```

## Starting jCustomer Locally

jCustomer is a Jahia technology that allows collecting and processing data from visitors to create personalized experiences, alongside its peer technology jExperience. Put together, they create what is known as a DXP, for Digital Experience Platform.

Running jCustomer locally is a bit tricky. You'll need to update both the `docker-compose.yml` and the `docker/provisioning.yml` files to add the jCustomer stack.

<details>
<summary><code>docker-compose.yml</code></summary>

1. Give the `jahia` service a static IP address:

   ```yaml
   services:
     jahia:
       # ...
       networks:
         default:
           ipv4_address: 172.16.1.100
   ```

2. Add the jCustomer containers:

   ```yaml
   services:
     # ...

     elasticsearch:
       image: elasticsearch:7.17.28
       ports:
         - 9200:9200
       environment:
         discovery.type: single-node
         cluster.name: jahia-es-cluster

     kibana:
       image: kibana:7.17.28
       ports:
         - 5601:5601
       environment:
         discovery.type: single-node
         elasticsearch.hosts: http://elasticsearch:9200

     jcustomer:
       image: jahia/jcustomer:2.6
       depends_on:
         - elasticsearch
       ports:
         - 9443:9443
         - 8181:8181
         - 8102:8102
       environment:
         UNOMI_ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESSES: elasticsearch:9200
         UNOMI_ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTERNAME: jahia-es-cluster
         UNOMI_CLUSTER_PUBLIC_ADDRESS: http://localhost:8181
         UNOMI_CLUSTER_INTERNAL_ADDRESS: https://jcustomer:9443
         UNOMI_THIRDPARTY_PROVIDER1_IPADDRESSES: 172.16.1.100
         UNOMI_THIRDPARTY_PROVIDER1_ALLOWEDEVENTS: login,updateProperties
         UNOMI_ROOT_PASSWORD: karaf
         UNOMI_HAZELCAST_TCPIP_MEMBERS: jcustomer
   ```

3. Add a network stack at the end of the file:

   ```yaml
   networks:
     default:
       ipam:
         config:
           - subnet: 172.16.1.0/24
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>docker/provisioning.yml</code></summary>

Add this at the end of the file:

```yaml
# Install and start jExperience
- installBundle:
    - "mvn:org.jahia.modules/jexperience/3.6.2"
    - "mvn:org.jahia.modules/jexperience-dashboards/1.0.0"
  autoStart: true
  uninstallPreviousVersion: true

# Configure jExperience
- editConfiguration: "org.jahia.modules.jexperience.settings"
  configIdentifier: "global"
  properties:
    jexperience.jCustomerURL: "https://jcustomer:9443"
    jexperience.jCustomerUsername: "karaf"
    jexperience.jCustomerPassword: "karaf"
    jexperience.jCustomerTrustAllCertificates: "true"
    jexperience.jCustomerUsePublicAddressesForAdmin: "false"
    jexperience.jCustomerKey: "670c26d1cc413346c3b2fd9ce65dab41"

# Configure Kibana dashboards
- editConfiguration: "org.jahia.modules.kibana_dashboards_provider"
  properties:
    kibana_dashboards_provider.kibanaURL: "http://kibana:5601"
    kibana_dashboards_provider.kibanaUser: "elastic"
    kibana_dashboards_provider.kibanaPassword: "ELASTIC_PASSWORD"
    kibana_dashboards_provider.KibanaProxy.enable: "true"
    kibana_dashboards_provider.KibanaProxy.cloud: "true"
- installBundle:
    - "mvn:org.jahia.modules/kibana-dashboards-provider/1.4.0"
  autoStart: true
  uninstallPreviousVersion: true
```

</details>

Once done, run `docker compose down jahia && docker compose up --wait` to start the containers. You need to enable both jExperience and jExperience Dashboards to the website you are using. You can do this by going to **Administration > Modules > jExperience > Usage in sites** and checking the box next to your website. Do the same for **jExperience Dashboards**.

![Enable jExperience](enable-jexperience.png)

Get back to jContent (the edition mode for your website). If all went well, you should see a new tab in the vertical bar: it's jExperience. You may need to refresh the page. Click on it, and you should see the default dashboards shipped with jExperience:

![jExperience Page Views Dashboard](jexperience-page-view-dashboard.png)

In the rest of this guide, we will push data to jCustomer and create a custom dashboard to visualize it.

## Pushing Data to jCustomer

When enabled on a website, jExperience will automatically inject a JavaScript object to pages that can be used to push data to it. This object is called `window.wem`, for Web Experience Manager. It can only be used in the browser.

Jahia is an open-source company and its DXP is no exception: we are the biggest contributors to the Apache Unomi project, which is the engine behind jCustomer. The `window.wem` object comes from the [apache/unomi-tracker](https://github.com/apache/unomi-tracker) package, which can be read in detail to discover all the features it offers.

jCustomer events are created out of two things:

- A source, which is the starting point of the event. It is usually the page where the event happened, but it can be anything else.
- A target, which is usually the action taking place (a click, a form submission, a navigation).

The combination of the two creates an event, representing a visitor interaction, that can be sent to jCustomer. Replace the `TODO` in the `handler` function with the following code to create an event and send it to jCustomer:

```tsx
// Replace TODO with this to push to jCustomer:
const source = wem.buildSourcePage();
const target = wem.buildTarget("feedback", "click", { happy });
const event = wem.buildEvent("click", target, source);
wem.collectEvents({ events: [event] });
```

The source of our _click_ event is this page the user is on, and the target is the action of clicking on the button. The interaction is of id `feedback` and of type `click`, with additional data: the value of `happy`. The event is then sent to jCustomer using the `collectEvents` method.

Once deployed, clicking the Yes or No button should send events to jCustomer. We will check that they are properly received in the next section. Click Yes and No a few times to generate some data.

## Visualizing Data in Kibana

The database used by jCustomer is Elasticsearch, which is often paired with Kibana, a visualization tool. We will use Kibana to visualize the data we just sent to jCustomer.

Open [localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) in your browser, and go to the **Discover** tab:

![Kibana Discover Tab](kibana-discover.png)

Select the `*-event` index and open a bigger time range to see all the events jCustomer received.

![Kibana Latest Events](latest-events.png)

Browse an event created by your feedback form to see the content of the event. You should see something like this:

![Kibana Event Details](kibana-event-details.png)

You can see the source and target of the event:

- The source is the page where the event happened, one interesting property is the `pagePath` property, which is the path of the page in the JCR.
- The target is the action that happened: the ID is `feedback`, the type is `click`, and the additional data is the value of `happy` (true or false).

We will create a custom dashboard to visualize the latest feedbacks and the trends of the feedback form.

Click the ⨁ icon next to the following fields to create a persisted search:

- `eventType` (should be `click`)
- `itemType` (should be `event`)
- `target.itemId` (should be `feedback`)
- `target.itemType` (should be `click`)

Once done you should see the 4 fields listed under the search bar.

You can click the ≡🜨 icon next to the following fields to make the table easier to understand without needing to extend the rows:

- `source.properties.pageInfo.pagePath`
- `target.properties.happy` (should be `true` or `false`)

Click the **Save** button and give it a name, for instance `All Feedbacks`.

![Save Kibana Search](save-kibana-search.png)

Browse the interface to create a new dashboard. Click **Create dashboard**:

![Kibana New Dashboard](new-dashboard.png)

We'll start with a basic list of incoming feedbacks: click **Add from library** and select the search you just created. You should see a table with all the feedbacks you sent to jCustomer:

![Kibana Dashboard Created from Search](dashboard-list.png)

Let's create a stacked bar chart to visualize the global satisfaction of users. Click **Create visualization** and paste `eventType: click and itemType: event and target.itemId: feedback and target.itemType: click` into the search bar.

This query is the same one as we did earlier by clicking the filter buttons, but as KQL, the Kibana Query Language. It allows to create very complex queries if you ever need to. You can read the [KQL documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html) for more information.

Drop **Records** onto the central panel to create a new visualization based on the search. In the right panel, in **Break down by** select **target.properties.happy**. You may use the **Status** color palette to get red and green colors for the two values.

![Creating the trend graph](create-trend-graph.png)

Click **Save and return** to get back to your dashboard. Arrange and name your graphs as you like, and click **Save** to save your dashboard. The name of the dashboard will be the name of the entry on Jahia's side, so make sure to name it something meaningful.

![Save your dashboard](save-your-dashboard.png)

Refresh the page in Jahia to see your new dashboard listed in the jExperience tab. Click on it to see the dashboard you just created. You can change the date range to see more or less data, and you can also use the **Refresh** button to refresh the data in real time.

![Dashboard in Jahia](dashboard-in-jahia.png)

## Packaging the Dashboard

Your dashboard currently exists only in your local instance of Jahia. In this section, we will package it inside your JavaScript Module so that it can be deployed to any Jahia instance.

Open the management console of Kibana (Analytics > Overview > Manage):

![Analytics Manage](analytics-manage.png)

In **Saved Objects**, select the dashboard you just created and click **Export**:

![Export Dashboard](export-dashboard.png)

You will get a `.ndjson` file that contains the dashboard and all the visualizations you created. Save this file as `settings/kibana-dashboard/dashboards/feedback.ndjson` to include it in your module.

Now, when your module is deployed, the dashboard will be automatically imported into Jahia. You can check that it works by deploying your module to a new Jahia instance and checking that the dashboard is available in the jExperience tab.
