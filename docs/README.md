Depending on who you are, you'll get started with Jahia in different ways.

- If you are a front-end developer, you can go straight to our [JavaScript modules guide.](/cms/{mode}/{lang}/sites/academy/home/get-started/front-end-developer/introduction.html) 
- If you are a Java developer, we have [a tutorial for you, with Java and JSP.](/cms/{mode}/{lang}/sites/academy/home/get-started/java-developers/running-the-docker-image.html)
- If you are not a developer at all, we have [an Editors-Marketers getting started guide.](/cms/{mode}/{lang}/sites/academy/home/get-started/editors-marketers/adding-a-new-page.html)

This documentation is meant for self-learning, but we also offer workshops and training sessions with our team. If you are interested in that, please [contact us.](https://www.jahia.com/contact)
