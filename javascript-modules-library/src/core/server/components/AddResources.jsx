 * @param {object} props - The properties for the component.
 * @param {boolean} [props.insert] - If true, the resource will be inserted into the document. Typically used for on-demand loading of resources.

 * @param {boolean} [props.defer] - If true, the resource will be deferred, i.e., loaded after the document has been parsed. For scripts, this means the script will not be executed until after the page has loaded.

 * @param {string} [props.inlineResource] - Inline HTML that markup will be considered as resource.
 * @param {string} [props.title] - The title of the resource. This is typically not used for scripts or stylesheets, but may be used for other types of resources.
 * @param {string} [props.key] - A unique key for the resource. This could be used to prevent duplicate resources from being added to the document.
 * @param {string} [props.targetTag] - The HTML tag where the resource should be added. This could be 'head' for resources that should be added to the <head> tag, 'body' for resources that should be added to the <body> tag, etc.
 * @param {string} [props.rel] - The relationship of the resource to the document. This is typically 'stylesheet' for CSS files.
 * @param {string} [props.media] - The media for which the resource is intended. This is typically used for CSS files, with values like 'screen', 'print', etc.
 * @param {string} [props.condition] - A condition that must be met for the resource to be loaded. This could be used for conditional comments in IE, for example.
